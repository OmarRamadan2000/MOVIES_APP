Utilizing the Flutter framework, I integrated the TMDB API to provide users with a
rich repository of movie and TV show data. Employing the BLoC state management
pattern and adhering to the Clean Architecture principles, the app is characterized
by an intuitive user interface,scalable and maintainable codebases.

Application features:
